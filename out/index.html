- Containers: Lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software environments.
- Purpose: Package applications with their dependencies to ensure consistent operation across environments.
- Isolation: Run independently from the host system and other containers using namespaces and cgroups.
- Efficiency: Share the host OS kernel, making them faster and less resource-intensive than virtual machines.
- Images: Containers are created from images, which are templates that define the container's filesystem and behavior.
- Portability: Run the same container on different machines, ensuring reproducibility.
- Orchestration: Can be managed and scaled using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- Networking: Communicate with each other and external systems via virtual networks.
- Use Cases: Application deployment, microservices architecture, testing, and development environments.

              <aside class="notes" data-markdown>**VM and Containers**  

Virtual Machines:
- Each VM runs a complete guest OS, independent of the host OS.
- Requires a hypervisor (e.g., VMware, KVM) to virtualize hardware.
- Heavyweight: High resource usage due to the full OS and virtualized hardware.
- Each VM has isolated storage, memory, and network interfaces.
- Slower startup times due to the need to boot an OS.
- Suitable for running different operating systems or applications with conflicting dependencies.
Containers:
- Share the host OS kernel; no separate guest OS.
- Use a container runtime (e.g., Docker, Podman) for managing resources.
- Lightweight: Efficient in resource usage, as they share the OS kernel.
- Provide process-level isolation with separate libraries and dependencies.
- Faster startup times, as they do not boot a full OS.
- Ideal for microservices architectures and consistent development environments.

Building Containers with a Dockerfile:
Dockerfile: A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.

Basic Structure:

- FROM: Specifies the base image (e.g., ubuntu, alpine).
- RUN: Executes commands during image build (e.g., install software).
- COPY/ADD: Copies files or directories into the image.
- CMD/ENTRYPOINT: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
- ENV: Sets environment variables.
- WORKDIR: Sets the working directory inside the container.
- EXPOSE: Documents which ports the container listens on.
- Commands Order: The order of instructions impacts the build process and the number of image layers created.

- Layered Architecture: Docker images are built in layers, with each instruction in the Dockerfile creating a new layer.
- Reusability: Layers are cached and reused if they haven't changed (e.g., RUN apt-get update).
- Read-Only Layers: All layers except the top writable layer are read-only.
- Layer Structure:
- The base layer comes from the FROM instruction.
- Each subsequent instruction (e.g., RUN, COPY) adds a new layer.
- Size Optimization:
- Combine RUN commands to reduce the number of layers (e.g., RUN apt-get update && apt-get install).
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
- Performance Benefits:
- Unchanged layers are cached, speeding up rebuilds.
- Modifying a layer invalidates only that layer and subsequent layers in the cache.

Standalone

Run containers using docker run or podman.
Simple and direct, suitable for single-host deployments.
Docker Compose

Define multi-container apps in docker-compose.yml.
Use docker-compose up for local dev or small-scale setups.
Kubernetes

Scalable, production-grade, with features like auto-scaling and load balancing.
Docker Swarm

Cluster setup with docker swarm init.
Use docker stack deploy for simpler orchestration than Kubernetes.
OpenShift

Kubernetes-based with enterprise features.
Includes web UI and CI/CD pipelines.
Nomad

Deploy containers alongside other workloads.
Lightweight and hybrid workload-friendly.
Managed Services

Examples: AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run.
Push images to registries; let the provider handle orchestration.
Edge/Hybrid

Tools: K3s, MicroK8s.
Deploy lightweight clusters for resource-constrained environments.
